          <p> Hi I'm Tolulope-Comfort APANISHILE and this is my portfolio website, a place I can share my personal and school projects on the subjects of Data Science
            I'm 24 years old and just recently graduated from the University Paris Saclay where I studied Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. During my studies, I gained 
            a healthy dose of respect for the subjects of Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
            I was able to learn the mathematical and computer science theory behind various Machine learning concepts as well as other Computer Science concepts such 
            as Algorithms, Complexity or Object Oriented Programming.
            I was also able to learn quite a number of programming languages such as R, Python, Java, C++ or C in order to put these concepts into practice. 
  
            I am a naturally curious person, with a good sense of organisation, making me an eager and fast learner (in and out of school). My sense of experimentation 
            means that I put everything I learn into practice at least once.
            These traits, in addition to my chosen field of study have lead me towards the field of Big Data and the roles of Data Analysis, Data Scientist or Machine Learning 
            Engineer to name a few.
